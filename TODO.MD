# Required Features:
1. Adding more Audio/Video formats to the Converter 

# General ToDo
1. Improve the Converter from Feedback.
2. add support for creating VMD's for the Game like as example to convert a MP3 / MP4 into a VMD that can be used by DEV in the Game.
3. add todo from Issues section

# In-Progress
1. DEV7 Support (its very complex, as we discussed at 15.06.2023 VMD's are very different under each other.) (a VMD from a English version of Adiboo3 (Demo) was able to get converted into MP3, but not into MP4 (MP3 version had a blitted Screen and the Palette is wrong.) (and also some VMD's of Adibou presente Dessin (1.1.0.0) can also convert some VMD Files, maybe they changed the Format of the VMD Files in version 1.2.0.0 and above?)
2. Fixing Bugs.

# Done
Multi Language (German & French) so the Language can be changed in the Converter over a Button / Menu.
add WAV support to the Converter.
